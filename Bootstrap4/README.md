Bootstrap4

Small website with a gallery using bootstrap with adding class "thumbnail" on all imgs.
When imgs have different heights appears problem with displaying gallery using col-md-6 (actually any size with "6" making strange result).
In this case we can see that between second and third img appear an empty space in which should be third img. For some reason it "jumps"
to next "slot" (appears when in row should be 2 imgs)
